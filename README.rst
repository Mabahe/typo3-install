==========================================
TYPO3 CMS Install Tool (typo3/cms-install)
==========================================

The Install Tool is used for installation, upgrade, system administration and
setup tasks.

It can be accessed via the Admin Tools module in the backend or through a
dedicated URL (typo3/install.php). The functionality (via the browser) is only
available for system maintainers.

Functionality via CLI is also provided, e.g. the upgrade wizards or the
installer can be executed on the command line.
